<p>GDZLLA was built in 2009 over the course of the week after Tweetie 2
   was released on the iPhone. With version 2, Loren Brichter's iconic
   app finally allowed custom services implementing the twitpic API to
   upload photos wherever they pleased. A group of nice folks at nclud wanted
   their photos on flickr, which was at the time—and still totally is—the
   best place to share photos in the Internet.

       <a href="//twitter.com/laurenmoon">@laurenmoon</a> and
       <a href="//twitter.com/drinks">@drinks</a>
   hacked for a few days and GDZLLA was born.

<p>Since 2010, I (<a href="//twitter.com/drinks">@drinks</a>) am the sole
   maintainer in my free time, but am totally happy to add stuff if
   there's a compelling use case; just drop me a line and let me know.
